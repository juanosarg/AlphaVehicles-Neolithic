	<!-- Stats Descriptions -->
	
	<AV_Tier0Desc>Tier 0 vehicles are below tier 1 in terms of simplicity. These are things like wheelbarrows and oxen carts. Usually they don't need any research projects to be built, but they are very, very underpowered.</AV_Tier0Desc>
	<AV_Tier1Desc>Tier 1 vehicles are the most basic and easiest to access. They are usually locked behind a very basic and general research project. They are inefficient, not ideal, have a lot of drawbacks, but they are cheap and quick to make.</AV_Tier1Desc>
	<AV_Tier2Desc>Tier 2 vehicles are locked behind a more specialized research project and are more efficient than Tier 1. They are however more expensive and take a longer time to construct. Tier 2 vehicles are a "baseline" vehicle category.</AV_Tier2Desc>
