	<!-- Stats Descriptions -->
	
	<AV_Tier0Desc>Tier 0 vehicles are the most basic and easiest to access. They don't require resources to be constructed, or research project to be researched, or both.</AV_Tier0Desc>
	<AV_Tier1Desc>Tier 1 vehicles require a basic research project and a low resource cost in order to be constructed. They are inefficient, not ideal, have a lot of drawbacks, but they are cheap and available early in the game.</AV_Tier1Desc>
	<AV_Tier2Desc>Tier 2 vehicles are locked behind more specialised research projects and require resources that are only available later in the game. Tier 2 is considered to be the 'baseline' of all vehicles.</AV_Tier2Desc>
	
	<AV_TractionHumanDesc>Human-powered vehicles consume no fuel. There is however a price to pay: the driver of a human-powered vehicle will get 50% more tired and hungry while driving it.</AV_TractionHumanDesc>
	<AV_TractionAnimalDesc>This vehicle is powered by animals. It will require no traditional fuel, but the animals need to be fed or they will refuse to move. The vehicle's animals will consume this food even when not in use. This is usually Hay or Kibble. Animals will not die if the "fuel" runs out because I'm not that cruel.</AV_TractionAnimalDesc>
	<AV_TractionCombustionDesc>This vehicle is powered by the combustion of a flammable fuel, usually wood.</AV_TractionCombustionDesc>
	
	<AV_Fuel8-50Desc>This vehicle can hold 50 units of wood, and its consumption rate is 8</AV_Fuel8-50Desc>
	<AV_Fuel5-100Desc>This vehicle can hold 100 units of hay, and its consumption rate is 5. It consumes hay even when not in use.</AV_Fuel5-100Desc>
	<AV_Fuel8-100Desc>This vehicle can hold 100 units of hay, and its consumption rate is 8. It consumes hay even when not in use.</AV_Fuel8-100Desc>
	<AV_Fuel5-100KibbleDesc>This vehicle can hold 100 units of kibble, and its consumption rate is 5. It consumes kibble even when not in use.</AV_Fuel5-100KibbleDesc>
	<AV_Fue10-250Desc>This vehicle can hold 250 units of hay, and its consumption rate is 10. It consumes hay even when not in use.</AV_Fue10-250Desc>
	<AV_Fue6-100Desc>This vehicle can hold 100 units of hay, and its consumption rate is 6. It consumes hay even when not in use.</AV_Fue6-100Desc>
	
	<AV_Wood75Desc>This vehicle can carry 75 wood. Each salvo of explosive arrows uses 8 wood.</AV_Wood75Desc>
	<AV_Wood75SingleDesc>This vehicle can carry 75 wood. Each arrow fired uses 1 wood.</AV_Wood75SingleDesc>
